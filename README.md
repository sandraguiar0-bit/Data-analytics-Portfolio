## Projects

### TOTALFINANCE: Financial Performance Analysis (2024)
**Objective**  

This project analyzes the financial performance of the Energy Market, taking a close look at TotalEnergies, Shell, and British Petroleum (BP), but also looking to compare it to the Euro Stoxx 50 index using historical market data from Yahoo Finance (from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023).
A complete Python code was developed to:

- Collect and clean financial time series data (from a CSV file)
- Calculate correlation metrics between these assets and report these calculations to excel
- Generate visualizations and charts
- Create an analytical report in PDF format with an interpretation of the results 


**Key Skills and tools**

- Python (Google Colab)
- Trend analysis
- Visualization

### The Role of Education Level in Youth Employment Integration
**Objective**  

This project explores the impact of educational attainment on youth employment and professional integration over time in France, using Data derived from the INSEE Database. After restructuring the data and creating graphs, I wrote a dissertation around this subject. The dissertation aims to assess whether career-oriented initial training effectively improves employability, and to what extent different education levels influence access to stable employment. Specifically, I examined whether obtaining a two-year post-secondary degree such as the _BTS (Brevet de Technologie Supérieur)_ enhances employability or, conversely, limits career opportunities, and whether pursuing higher education significantly increases the likelihood of securing stable, long-term employment.

**Key Skills**
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization
- Economic analysis

### Financial analysis of LVMH, Air Liquide, and CAC40 
**Objective**  

In this project the goal was to analyze and compare stock market performance, volatility, and trends of **LVMH, CAC40, and Air Liquide**. A CSV dataset containing historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance was provided and transformed into a structured Excel file using VBA automation. The Excel macro:
- Cleans and restructures the dataset
- Computes key financial indicators (correlation matrix, volatility, standard deviation, trends)
- Automatically generates visual charts
- Produces an HTML financial analysis report


**Key Skills**
- Excel VBA
- Data visualization
- Market trend analysis

CSV Source file with tha data: https://github.com/sandraguiar0-bit/Data-analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Data-Exam-L1-2026.csv

Excel file with the Macro: https://github.com/sandraguiar0-bit/Data-analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Projet_VBA_SANDRA.xlsm

Note (Mac users):
If you are using macOS, ensure the CSV file opens in Excel (not Numbers) before running the macro. Then run the macro "Projet_VBA2025", select the CSV file, and the automated analysis will execute.
