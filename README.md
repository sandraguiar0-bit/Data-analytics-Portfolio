## Projects

### TOTALFINANCE — Financial Performance Analysis
**Objective**  

This project analyzes the financial performance of the Energy Market, taking a close look at TotalEnergies, Shell, British Petroleum (BP), but also looking to compare it to the the Euro Stoxx 50 index using historical market data from Yahoo Finance (from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023).
A complete Python code was developed to:

- Collect and clean financial time series data (from a CSV file)
- Calculate correlation metrics between these assets and report these calculations to excel
- Generate visualizations and charts
- Create a PDF analytical report with an interpretation of the results 


**Key Skills and tools**
- Financial metrics calculation
- Trend analysis
- Visualization
- Python (Google Colab)

### The Role of Education Level in Youth Employment Integration
**Objective**  

This project explores the impact of educational attainment on youth employment and professional integration over time in France, using Data derived from the INSEE Database (https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/source/operation/s2127/presentation). After restructuring the data and creating graphs I then wrote a dissertation around this subject. The dissertation aims to assess whether career-oriented initial training effectively improves employability, and to what extent different education levels influence access to stable employment. Specifically, I examined whether obtaining a two-year post-secondary degree such as the _BTS (Brevet de Technologie Supérieur)_ enhances employability or, conversely, limits career opportunities, and whether pursuing higher education significantly increases the likelihood of securing stable, long-term employment.

**Key Skills**
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization
- Economic analysis

### Financial analysis of LVMH, Air Liquide, and CAC40 
**Objective**  

In this project the goal was to analyze and compare stock market performance, volatility, and trends of **LVMH, CAC40, and Air Liquide**. A CSV dataset containing historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance was provided and transformed into a structured Excel file using VBA automation. The Excel macro:
- Cleans and restructures the dataset
- Computes key financial indicators (correlation matrix, volatility, standard deviation, trends)
- Automatically generates visual charts
- Produces an HTML financial analysis report


**Key Skills**
- Excel VBA
- Data visualization
- Market trend analysis 

CSV Source file with tha data: https://github.com/sandraguiar0-bit/Data-analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Data-Exam-L1-2026.csv

Excel file with the Macro: https://github.com/sandraguiar0-bit/Data-analytics-Portfolio/blob/main/Projet_VBA_SANDRA.xlsm

Note (Mac users):
If you are using macOS, ensure the CSV file opens in Excel (not Numbers) before running the macro. Then run the macro "Projet_VBA2025", select the CSV file, and the automated analysis will execute.
