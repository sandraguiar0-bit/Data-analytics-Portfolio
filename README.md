## Projects

### TOTALFINANCE — Financial Performance Analysis
**Objective**  

This project analyzes the financial performance of the Energy Market, taking a close look at TotalEnergies, Shell, British Petroleum (BP), but also looking to compare it to the the Euro Stoxx 50 index using historical market data from Yahoo Finance (from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023).
A complete Python code was developed to:

- Collect and clean financial time series data (from a CSV file)
- Calculate correlation metrics between these assets and report these calculations to excel
- Generate visualizations and charts
- Create a PDF analytical report with an interpretation of the results 


**Key Skills and tools**
- Financial metrics calculation
- Trend analysis
- Visualization
- Python (Google Colab)

### The Role of Education Level in Youth Employment Integration
**Objective**  

This project explores the impact of educational attainment on youth employment and professional integration over time in France, using Data derived from the INSEE Database (https://www.insee.fr/fr/metadonnees/source/operation/s2127/presentation). After restructuring the data and creating graphs I then wrote a dissertation around this subject. The dissertation aims to assess whether career-oriented initial training effectively improves employability, and to what extent different education levels influence access to stable employment. Specifically, I examined whether obtaining a two-year post-secondary degree such as the _BTS (Brevet de Technologie Supérieur)_ enhances employability or, conversely, limits career opportunities, and whether pursuing higher education significantly increases the likelihood of securing stable, long-term employment.

**Key Skills**
- Data cleaning
- Data visualization
- Economic analysis

### Financial analysis of LVMH, Air Liquide, and CAC40 
**Objective**  

In this project the goal was to analyze and compare stock market performance, volatility, and trends of **LVMH, CAC40, and Air Liquide**. A CSV dataset containing multiple stock prices since the beginning of the year, sourced from Yahoo Finance, was provided for analysis and transformed into a structured Excel file containing fundamental statistics useful for financial insights (correlation matrix, standard deviations etc.), all using VBA. Once all of the data is reported onto Excel, the code then creates an HTML page containing a financial interpretation and analysis of the data. 


**Key Skills**
- Excel VBA
- Data visualization
- Market trend analysis
